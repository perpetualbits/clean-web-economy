# FAQ: How Many Volunteers Are Needed for CWE, and What Skills Matter?

**Version:** Draft v1.0
**Status:** Public-Facing FAQ Article

---

## 1. Short Answer

The Clean Web Economy (CWE) can begin with **30–50 highly skilled volunteers** for the MVP, grow to **200–400 contributors** during early public launch, and eventually stabilize with **1,000+ global contributors** similar to mature open-source ecosystems (Linux, Firefox, Blender, VLC, GNOME, KDE).

Volunteers are needed across *many* disciplines — not just programmers. CWE is an ecosystem for culture, not simply a software project.

## 2. Why CWE Needs a Large and Diverse Volunteer Base

CWE is:

* A distributed storage network
* A cryptographic protocol suite
* A discovery/search system
* A creator-first economy
* A governance DAO
* A set of clients and plugins
* An ecosystem supporting music, film, writing, art

This means the project spans:

* Advanced engineering
* Cybersecurity
* Governance and law
* UX and design
* UI, branding, educational materials
* Creator relations
* Community management

**No single discipline can build CWE alone.**

## 3. MVP Phase (First 12–18 Months)

### **Team size: ~30–50 volunteers**

The minimum team needed to build a functional, testable CWE prototype.

### **Core Roles**

#### 3.1 Protocol Engineers (6–10)

Skills:

* TypeScript, Rust, Go, or C++
* Blockchain or cryptographic systems
* ZK proofs (Starkware, zkSync, Halo2)
* P2P networking

#### 3.2 ZK Engineers / Cryptographers (3–6)

Skills:

* SNARK/STARK circuit design
* Merkle proofs
* Poseidon/Keccak/BLAKE3 hashing
* Security audits

#### 3.3 Client Developers (5–8)

Skills:

* Browser extension architecture
* Media players (VLC, MPV, WebAssembly)
* Cross-platform desktop + mobile

#### 3.4 Storage Node & DMF Developers (5–8)

Skills:

* Distributed systems / P2P
* Erasure coding (Reed–Solomon)
* Secure multi-operator federation

#### 3.5 UX/UI & Frontend (3–5)

Skills:

* Human-centric design
* Accessibility
* Internationalization

#### 3.6 Governance & Legal (3–6)

Skills:

* IP law
* Privacy law (GDPR, CPRA, ePrivacy)
* Cooperative governance
* DAO constitutional rules

#### 3.7 Creator Relations (3–5)

Responsibilities:

* Constants with musicians, filmmakers, artists
* User testing
* Explaining fingerprinting and splits

These numbers produce an MVP capable of:

* Fingerprinting works
* Submitting usage
* Running storage nodes
* Producing ZK rollups
* Paying creators fairly

## 4. Public Launch Phase (100k–1M users)

### **Team size: 200–400 active contributors**

Now the focus expands to reliability, global support, cultural adoption, and legal resilience.

### **Additional Needed Disciplines**

#### 4.1 Sysadmins & SREs (15–30)

Skills:

* Large-scale Linux operations
* Observability: Prometheus/Grafana
* Global DMF coordination

#### 4.2 Security Researchers (10–20)

Skills:

* Threat modeling
* Pen-testing plugins, storage nodes, DMF microservices
* Cryptographic audits

#### 4.3 Documentation & Education (10–20)

Skills:

* Technical writing
* Public outreach
* Tutorial creation

#### 4.4 Marketing & Outreach (10–20)

Skills:

* Social media
* Creator community building
* Explainer videos

#### 4.5 Translators (20–30)

Multilingual outreach is critical for global adoption.

#### 4.6 Moderation & Arbitration Volunteers (20–40)

Tasks:

* Resolve attribution disputes
* Handle manifest conflicts
* Ensure fair governance

#### 4.7 Artists, Musicians, Filmmakers (∞)

Creators are not just beneficiaries — they help:

* Test tooling
* Improve discovery
* Provide feedback
* Innovate in business models

---

## 5. Mature Global Ecosystem Phase

### **Team size: 1,000+ distributed volunteers**

This mirrors:

* Linux kernel ecosystem
* Wikipedia’s global contributors
* Mozilla community
* OpenStreetMap’s mapping army

At this stage CWE becomes:

* A cultural commons
* A platform for creators worldwide
* A sustainable long-term digital economy

### **Additional Roles**

#### Community organizers

#### Event coordinators

#### DAO delegates

#### Academic researchers

#### University open-source clubs

#### Policy analysts

Open governance ensures CWE evolves with society.
