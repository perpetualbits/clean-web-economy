# Join the Clean Web Economy

**Let’s fund culture without selling our souls.**

We’re building an open, ad‑free web where everyone—creators, engineers, legal minds, and everyday users—can help.

## Why Now
Ads dominate the web. Platforms track us. Artists get pennies. CWE flips the model: one monthly fee → direct creator income through privacy‑preserving proofs.

## Who We Need
- **Engineers & Sysadmins** – build clients, contracts, storage, governance.
- **Cryptographers** – optimize zero‑knowledge and security layers.
- **Musicians & Filmmakers** – seed the catalog, test payouts, share feedback.
- **Designers & Writers** – make tools beautiful and clear.
- **Lawyers & Policy Experts** – shape licenses, compliance, and defense.
- **Activists & NGOs** – verify environmental assets and social impact.

## How to Help
1. Visit **github.com/cleanweb‑economy**.  
2. Read the Architecture Blueprint and Roadmap.  
3. Pick an issue labeled _good first issue_.  
4. Join the conversation—bring your skills and ideals.

Together we can rebuild the web around fairness, privacy, and culture.
