We’re building an open, ad‑free web where everyone can help.

== Why Now
Ads dominate the web. Platforms track us. Artists get pennies.

== Who We Need
• Engineers & Sysadmins  
• Cryptographers  
• Musicians & Filmmakers  
• Designers & Writers  
• Lawyers & Policy Experts  
• Activists & NGOs

== How to Help
1. Visit github.com/cleanweb‑economy  
2. Read the Architecture Blueprint and Roadmap  
3. Pick a _good first issue_  
4. Join the conversation.

Together we can rebuild the web around fairness, privacy, and culture.
