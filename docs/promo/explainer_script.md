[Logo Placeholder — Clean Web Economy]

**Voice‑over Script (≈ 90 s)**

What if the Internet didn’t need ads—or tracking—to pay creators?

Today we juggle subscriptions, see constant ads, and artists earn pennies.

CWE changes that. You pay one simple monthly tier. Your browser or player keeps a private log of what you enjoy and sends a zero‑knowledge proof—cryptographic math that says *I listened* without showing what.

Smart contracts fairly split your fee among the works you loved. Artists get paid instantly. No ads, no tracking, no middlemen.

Files live on a decentralized network. Creators sell, collaborate, and connect through open microservices. Governance is democratic and transparent.

Help build the Clean Web Economy—engineers, creators, legal minds, everyone. Fork the repo, join a discussion, and help fund culture without selling our souls.
