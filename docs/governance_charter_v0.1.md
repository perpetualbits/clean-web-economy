# Clean Web Economy — Governance Charter v0.1

**Author:** Roland Nagtegaal & ChatGPT (GPT-5)

**Status:** Draft — Foundational Charter

**Purpose:** Define the constitutional framework, rights, responsibilities, and governance mechanisms of the Clean Web Economy (CWE) DAO — the decentralized organization that oversees the operation, policy, and integrity of the Clean Web ecosystem.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Mission Statement

The **Clean Web Economy (CWE)** exists to ensure fair, transparent, and privacy-respecting compensation for all digital creators while empowering consumers to experience media without advertisements, surveillance, or monopolistic gatekeepers.

### 1.2 Governance Principle

Governance shall be **decentralized, transparent, verifiable, and human-centered**, conducted through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) built upon verifiable human identity and smart-contract enforcement.

### 1.3 Definition

> **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):** A rule-based digital cooperative governed by verifiable members through blockchain-based voting, where proposals and financial actions are executed automatically by smart contracts.

## 2. Membership

### 2.1 Classes of Membership

1. **Consumer Members** — Users who pay subscription tiers (Light/Medium/Heavy) and wish to vote on system-wide policy or ethical matters.
2. **Creator Members** — Verified creators (musicians, filmmakers, journalists, etc.) participating in the economy.
3. **Node Operators** — Individuals or entities hosting network or storage nodes.
4. **Auditors** — Verified experts who evaluate environmental assets, smart contracts, and financial flows.
5. **Observers** — Non-voting entities (NGOs, research institutes, regulators) granted read-only access to governance data.

### 2.2 Verification

* All members must hold a **Verifiable Credential (VC)** bound to a human identity.
* Each VC corresponds to **one governance identity** (1 person = 1 vote principle).
* Identity verification employs **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** protocols, compatible with EU eIDAS and global equivalents.

### 2.3 Rights

Members have the right to:

* Submit proposals and vote on DAO matters.
* Inspect governance and treasury records.
* Appeal moderation and arbitration decisions.

## 3. Governance Structure

### 3.1 Overview

The DAO operates through a **multi-chamber structure** for checks and balances:

| Chamber                      | Function                                                                         | Composition                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **General Assembly**         | Approves proposals, elects councils, ratifies changes.                           | All verified members (1 person = 1 vote).     |
| **Council of Creators**      | Focuses on creator rights, economic models, and licensing standards.             | Elected creators.                             |
| **Council of Consumers**     | Represents consumer experience, privacy, and ethical oversight.                  | Elected consumers.                            |
| **Auditor & Ethics Council** | Oversees resource-backed token audits, legal compliance, and ethical guidelines. | Rotating experts and elected representatives. |
| **Arbitration Jury Pool**    | Handles disputes over content, moderation, or smart contracts.                   | Randomly selected from verified volunteers.   |

### 3.2 Voting Rights

* Each verified human holds one vote, regardless of wealth or stake.
* Certain technical or emergency actions may require **supermajority thresholds** (e.g., 66% approval).
* Quadratic weighting may apply for funding proposals to balance popularity vs. passion.

### 3.3 Delegation

* Members may delegate votes to trusted representatives, with **full transparency of delegation chains**.
* Delegation can be revoked at any time.

## 4. Proposal System

### 4.1 Proposal Types

| Type                  | Scope                                                  | Voting Requirement           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Policy**            | Governance rules, economic formulas, or ethical codes. | Simple majority.             |
| **Technical Upgrade** | Protocol or smart contract changes.                    | 2/3 majority + formal audit. |
| **Funding Request**   | Allocation of DAO treasury resources.                  | Quadratic vote.              |
| **Emergency Action**  | Critical security or legal compliance change.          | 80% council consensus.       |

### 4.2 Lifecycle

1. **Submission** → Member proposes change, co-signed by at least 5 verified members.
2. **Discussion** → 7–30 day debate window in public DAO forum.
3. **Vote** → Smart contract-managed voting.
4. **Execution** → Automatic enforcement upon threshold.
5. **Appeal (if applicable)** → Arbitration process if disputes arise.

## 5. Treasury & Finance

### 5.1 Resource-Backed Token Treasury

* The DAO controls the issuance and backing of the **Clean Token (CLN)**.
* All asset proofs (forests, water reserves, renewable projects) are publicly auditable.
* DAO Treasury maintains emission and redistribution policies.

### 5.2 Expenditure Rules

* Treasury funds may support: open-source development, audits, education, ecosystem grants, carbon offsets.
* Large expenditures (>1% treasury) require two-stage approval: Council review + General Assembly vote.

### 5.3 Revenue Sources

* Fractional transaction fees from the network.
* Optional donations or grants.
* Yield from renewable energy or environmental asset partnerships.

---

## 6. Ethics & Oversight

### 6.1 Ethics Council

* Reviews moral controversies, cultural fairness, and systemic bias.
* Issues **non-binding recommendations** published quarterly.

### 6.2 Arbitration Juries

* Randomly selected jurors adjudicate disputes (content, payouts, impersonation).
* Juries are paid small rewards for participation.
* Appeals possible to a higher random jury pool.

### 6.3 Transparency & Audits

* All decisions logged on-chain.
* Annual audit of governance smart contracts, treasury, and council operations.

---

## 7. Amendment Process

### 7.1 Charter Amendments

* Proposed by 5% of active members or 3 councils jointly.
* Requires 2/3 majority and 30-day review period.
* Amendments cannot violate core principles: privacy, fairness, decentralization.

### 7.2 Emergency Powers

* Temporary executive committees (max 90 days) can act on urgent technical/legal matters.
* Must dissolve automatically unless ratified by General Assembly.

---

## 8. Dissolution or Forking

* The DAO may be **forked** if consensus falls below 50% sustained support for 6 months.
* Treasury assets divide proportionally by verified member count at time of fork.
